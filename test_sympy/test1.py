def generate_nonuniform_grid_D():

    Generates a nonuniform grid in D with a coarse grid covering most of the domain
    and a finer grid near the boundary (y=0). The coarse grid uses a uniform partition
    of size h0 in both x and y directions, while the fine grid uses h1 for the x-axis and
    h2 for the y-axis.
    
    The fine grid covers y in [y1, y3] and the coarse grid covers y in [y3, y2],
